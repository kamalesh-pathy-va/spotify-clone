# Spotify Clone

---

This is a Spotify web clone made with React.js, Redux toolkit and Tailwind CSS. Live preview available at [Spotify Clone - Kamaleshpathy](https://spotify-clone-pi-tan.vercel.app/)

It is a frontend project so all the pages that are available are some what a template, I'm hoping to implement the backend in the future.

I've implemented responsiveness then and there, but it is a clone of Spotify's web player so the mobile view is not implemented
